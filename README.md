# Privacy Risks of Conference Calls
Project conducted together with Zabeo Alberto during the course [Research Methodology and Scientific Writing](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/II2202?l=en) held at KTH.

In our work we developed an acoustic eavesdropping attack, specifically examining the feasibility of reconstructing typed text from the audio stream of a video conference call with little or no prior information.
